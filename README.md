# duetoday
A todo list that focuses on what can be done today.

## Why?

- The only TODO list that has ever worked for me is a list of the things I can accomplish *today*.  This project builds a backend to replace the simple text files I've been using.
- Explore REST backend development using [Goa](http://goa.design).
- Practice building multiple frontends:  web, mobile, and command line.
